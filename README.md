## ConvertX


#### Instalation


Change the values and add into a empty script tag in html file of your site
```javascript 
        const USER = 9282;
        const TOKEN = "token";
```


Add these tags to your page to import the js files that will get the page actions
```HTML
    <script src="/convertx/index.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="/convertx/jquery-3.6.3.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

**Notes**

This is a pre-release of a pre-alpha version, I need to allocate this app on a server to be able to deliver the scripts through CDN
